-Importing a full board state every time something happens is a bit much
-Maybe import only when initially loading?  Eventually.
-For now, focus on interpreting movement
-Send string based instructions 
-What do I need to connect?
>functions: capture, despawn, placement
>Add new function: save, load

-How will the board be stored?
>Not the board needing to be stored-the pieces both active and captured
>Change all to two char names - create dict that will be used to house different pieces' constructors
