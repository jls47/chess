OVERVIEW

This is a game of chess made with mouse and touchscreen input in mind.  I will add support for text-based input at some point.  
This also contains piece guiding for players new to the game.  

TECHNOLOGY USED

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  The behavior of the pieces was made with object-oriented principles and simple matrix math to determine possible moves.
The board is set up with cartesian coordinates, so that placement calculation is very simple.
